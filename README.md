# Vendor-A-Analysis
This analysis takes a look at vendor information regarding inspections performed across several states between 2012-2022. Within it, exploratory analysis of the outcomes of inspections submitted by the vendor, as well as individual state stastics, are visualized. 

## Description
One of the first conclusions uncovered by these analusos was the fact that approximately 13% of all cases result in cancellations - the state with the highest likelihood of cancellations is NY:

Upon further research, it seems that the bulk of inspections have been performed on houses built between 1980-2010:

Interestingly, the state which had the biggest discrepancy between quoted replcaement cost estimates and actual post-inspection replacement cost estimates was FL, with an average +8.5% dicrepancy:
